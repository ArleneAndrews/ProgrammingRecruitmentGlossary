Finding a person to fit on your team is a challenge, and only gets worse when you are trying to figure out what a Team's culture is, or find someone for another Development Team. This section will help with the 'soft' skills: those that transfer from position to position – and may not seem to have any real relevance to working any job, in some Applicant 's eyes. 

In-Office Skills:

One big item with any Development Team is the way they work: some places have large teams, divided into smaller tasks, others have small teams working on a single project. Ignoring the positives and negatives of each approach, you need to look at how the Applicant works best, and in what role. An Applicant that does not enjoy a Development Team's approach is an unhappy worker, Make sure that the specifics of a Development Team is there, and listen well to the way the Applicant responds to the questions on team work.

Some of the many tasks in Development Teams will include the rotation of duties, and this needs to be addressed. Are you, the Applicant, comfortable in taking on multiple roles? Is there an area where you feel weak? Recruiters can use these answers to find a position where the Applicant has the opportunity to learn from a mentor, and gain the skills and confidence, without placing them on a Development Team that needs someone who can shine in that area. 

Some of the smaller items -- to someone who is not a member of a Development Team – can have a huge effect on the suitability of an Applicant to a particular Team. The work space is a common question: some Applicants feel an open floor plan is wonderful for most of the time, but would prefer to have a quiet area available to work on a particular section. 

Any eyesight or physical issues of sitting need to be noted, and addressed by a potential Development Team. These can affect the ability of an Applicant to be effective.
