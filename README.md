This is a comprehensive guide for Recruiting buzzwords, to help bridge the gap between Recruiters and Developers. The intention of this document is to differentiate concepts and implementations of concepts. By doing this, we can benefit recruiters by reducing their rejection rate for able and willing developers, and benefit developers by giving them a greater understanding of how their skills can translate across technologies.

The planned architecture for this is to separate concepts and keywords into their most basic trees and forms, and then to flatten those branches on each layer so that on each layer we can find the keyword we need and be hyperlinked to the section we need, and then see the progression backwards

Example:

on Versioning we will see:
